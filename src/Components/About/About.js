                  The Context API is a React structured who gives us permission
                  to share information one component to another. and solving a
                  big issue called prop-drilling. React Context API is a way to
                  share data or information effectively and less code repeating.
                  Context API is a (kind of) new feature added in version 16.3
                  of React that allows one to share state across the entire app
                  (or part of it) lightly and with ease. we have to use this
                  function React.createContext(). and has provider key to share
                  data to own childrens.

              Inline Block is a feature of html5. Some of them are inline block
              and some of are block element. an inline block element only take
              space where it's stand for.Inline-block elements are similar to
              inline elements, except they can have padding and margins added on
              all four sides. You'll have to declare display: inline-block in
              your CSS code. One common use for using inline-block is for
              creating navigation links horizontally, as shown below.
