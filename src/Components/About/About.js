        It's tough to establish one all-encompassing template for your About
        page — there are so many ways you can go about telling your company
        story. The good news is, there are some tried-and-true steps to get you
        started.
      </p>
      <li className="mt-6">
        1. Establish a mission statement. Your About page can and will be more
        comprehensive than a single mission statement, but to draw people in,
        you need to succinctly state your goal in the industry upfront. What is
        your business here to do? Why should your website visitors care? This
        information will give the reader something to remember about your
        company long after they leave your website.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Outline your company story. Every business has a story to tell. Even
        if you're running a start-up, you might not have a long history of
        changes and growth (yet), but it's a nice touch to talk about how you
        got to where you are on the About page. So, isolate the milestones
        before your company's founding, and use them to give readers some
        backstory on your current venture.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Reveal how you've evolved. There's no shame in admitting how your
        business strategy — or even your way of thinking — has changed since you
        began. In fact, these evolutions can improve the story you tell to
        website visitors. About pages are perfect spaces to talk about where you
        started, how you've grown, and the ideals that have helped your
        organization mature. Use these moments to further your company story and
        show people that you're always ready to change and adapt to the needs of
        your industry.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. State your "aha!" moment. Every good company was founded on an idea —
        something the current marketplace might not yet offer. What was your
        idea? Use this "Aha!" moment as a pivot point when telling your company
        story. What was a challenge you faced while developing your company? How
        did this challenge or discovery shape what you are today?
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Explain who you serve. As much as you want as many eyeballs on your
        About page as possible, you won't do business with every single one of
        them. That's why you must identify and mention your core customer. This
        lets your visitors know what your business is dedicated to helping them
        meet their needs and goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        6.Explain what you're offering them. As you're explaining who you serve,
        make it clear what it is you're offering. Companies often generalize
        their products or services in the website copy, making it hard to
        understand what it is the customer is actually paying for. Sometimes,
        businesses are afraid that the literal explanations of their products
        aren't interesting enough or will sound unappealing in writing. And
        that's a fair concern. However, investing just a sentence or two into
        telling your potential customers exactly what they'll receive can keep
        them on your website for longer and get them interested in learning
        more.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. Cite examples of clients you've served. Got some loyal customers in
        your portfolio? Use your About page to let the world know who already
        trusts and benefits from your work. A great way to showcase this is
        through a case study. Knowing about your company's past successes can
        influence your prospects' purchasing decisions because they will be able
        to envision their success in the success of your past customers.
